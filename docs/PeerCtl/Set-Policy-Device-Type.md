# Set Policy & Device Type

Setting the Policy allows users to set the default router configuration at a given network. There are two default options for setting the Policy: Global or Inherit Policy. Custom policies can also be created. The option chosen will be the default for all connections at this port. To choose a policy, click on the gear icon next to the Exchange/Port.
