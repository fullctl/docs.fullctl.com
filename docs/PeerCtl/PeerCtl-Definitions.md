# PeerCtl Overview / Definitions

## Overview

When a user first logs into peerCtl, available peers will be shown but active peers will not. To display active peers in FullCtl, peering must be requested through the portal. Instructions for setting up peering manually are found on the following pages. Another option for setting up peering in an automated manner is through the FullCtl Referee system. Learn more about Referee [here](.../Referee/Overview/). To explore adding Referee to your system, Contact Us <hello@fullctl.com>.
