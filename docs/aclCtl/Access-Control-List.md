# Access Control List
aclCtl allows users to maintain a list of rules that regulate where traffic will/will not go. Filter rules can be added, edited and deleted. The rules can also be prioritized.

Access Control Lists are used to manage filter rules. The filter rules are contained within Access Control Lists. There can be multiple lists of rules. To add a new list, click on New List under Access Control List on the left.
