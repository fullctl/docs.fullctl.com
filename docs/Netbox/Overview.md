# NetBox Overview

FullCtl offers NetBox integration. NetBox is a tool for modeling and documenting networks covering IP address management, cabling, overlays, and more. NetBox provides a source of truth to power network automation. [Netbox Documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/) 

FullCtl allows the synchronization of NetBox data to PeerCtl as well as to send updates to NetBox. If you prefer that NetBox drive device configurations and manage devices, PeerCtl can push the needed information to NetBox. Likewise, you can pull your “Facilities” (locations / PoPs) from PeeringDB and push them into NetBox, providing live updates from PDB. Alternatively, you can pull device and interface information from NetBox into PeerCtl for direct router management within PeerCtl.
