Entering your billing information does not automatically charge your credit card. Charges are applied when FullCtl Administration turns on your paid service subscription. Once your subscription is turned on you will be charged monthly. Your current subscriptions and monthly costs appear in the Service Charges list. Click the arrow to expand the list.
