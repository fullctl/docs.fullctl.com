2. Click on + Invite Users to Your Organization. In the pop-up box, enter the email address of the person you are inviting. Click on Send Invite. The person invited will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation. If they do not receive the message, there is a link to Re-Send the Invitation. When they click on the link in their email they will be directed to the 20C website to create an account. If the person already has an account, pending invitations will appear in the right-side menu bar under Invites.

5. User roles (e.g., admin, member) can be chosen from the drop-down menu. A user can have more than one role. Each role has specific read/write privileges by default. The roles can be customized using the checkboxes. The Remove button provides the option of removing the User from the Organization.
