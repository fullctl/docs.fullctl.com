The Reputation status will appear as either “Issues” to indicate the check found a problem with one or more of the Prefix Sets or “Ok” to indicate there are no problems with the Prefix Sets. The specific prefix with issues will appear in the list view.

In the pop-up box, issues can be identified by scrolling to find items flagged. Clicking on History provides a list of issues at the same IP address over the past 12 months. In the history view, each entry indicates a specific issue at the IP address at the point it was seen.
