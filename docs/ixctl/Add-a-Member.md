# Add a Member

Prefix lists and AS-SETs are populated from the IRRs. The AS-SET names come from PeeringDB by default. These can be overridden in ixCtl but it is best to update them in PeeringDB. 
Before adding a member to ixCtl, ensure the member has:
- Registered their prefix with radb (fee based), ARIN (if lacking legacy space) or altdb.
- Entered/updated their AS-Set in PeeringDB.

Select the Exchange to which a member will be added from the header menu.
